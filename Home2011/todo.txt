optimization
------------
ExpiresByType caching
preload base images at start of script, so they load while script is running
when clicking on a segment (as opposed to scrolling), load iframe immediately
try to get transitions to work in ff4
at startup lay out strips for zoomed and not, and save position.

cleanup

don't round x and y (round when setting css)

later
-----
reflow when resizing window (without destroying site)

ideas
-----
colored titles and strips?

notes

pause when bringing in scrollbar only happens if page is animatable
faster in firefox 3 when rotation is zero
hiding site when scrolling down causes huge hiccup when scrolling back up
