<p>In March 2007, a short story contest was held at <a href="http://machineofdeath.net/">machineofdeath.net</a>.  The stories were to take place in a world containing this machine:</p>

<div class="quote">
The machine had been invented a few years ago: a machine that could tell, from just a sample of your blood, how you were going to die. It didn't give you the date and it didn't give you specifics. It just spat out a sliver of paper upon which were printed, in careful block letters, the words "DROWNED" or "CANCER" or "OLD AGE" or "CHOKED ON A HANDFUL OF POPCORN". It let people know how they were going to die.

<h1>ALBATROSS</h1>
<h2>by Bret Victor</h2>


<h4>PART I</h4>

<p>It was an ancient mariner<br/>
who stopped me as I passed.<br/>
His legs were pegs of weathered wood.<br/>
His eyes were globes of glass.</p>

<p>"There was a ship," he hissed, and gripped<br/>
my arm with fingers pale.<br/>
Despite my fright, his hand held tight,<br/>
and here began his tale.</p>

<p>"The eve before we left the shore,<br/>
the tavern roared," he said.<br/>
"The crew caroused -- alive, aloud.<br/>
I drank alone, in dread."</p>

<p>"At sea await a thousand deaths.<br/>
A thousand deaths I feared.<br/>
I dreaded, drank, and dreaded more,<br/>
then drew the barman near."</p>

<p>"'Have you charms to ward off harm?<br/>
Cauls, and talismans too?'<br/>
The barman laughed, 'O fearful man!<br/>
Naught steers your fate but you.'"</p>

<p>"'Might this suffice? -- a grim device<br/>
which states how you'll succumb.<br/>
A thousand deaths snuff mortal breaths,<br/>
but you'll need fear just one.'"</p>

<p>"And as my crewmates danced and laughed,<br/>
and sang 'neath starry sky,<br/>
I took the barman's cursed machine.<br/>
I asked how I would die."</p>

<p>The mariner drew back his hand,<br/>
and thrice his chest he crossed.<br/>
Within his grip, a tattered slip<br/>
with one word:  ALBATROSS.</p>


<h4>PART II</h4>

<p>"The blaze of dawn lit sapphire skies.<br/>
The breeze blew strong toward sea.<br/>
A merry crew bid land adieu,<br/>
merry all but me."</p>

<p>"Toward blaze of dawn, our prow was drawn.<br/>
The breeze ballooned our sails.<br/>
The crew sang jigs and raised the rigs.<br/>
I clutched my death's details."</p>

<p>"As land grew small, the captain called:<br/>
'The crow's nest needs a man!'<br/>
My gaze surveyed the look-out's perch.<br/>
My mind devised a plan."</p>

<p>"The mainmast spans from sea to sky.<br/>
From sea to sky, I climbed --<br/>
the barman's slip still in my grip,<br/>
a shotgun at my spine."</p>

<p>"I stood above the world now.<br/>
No movement missed my eyes.<br/>
The crew supposed I scanned the seas,<br/>
but no!  I scanned the skies!"</p>

<p>"The sun, it flew through cloudless blue,<br/>
and plunged into the green.<br/>
The moon, it swam through glittered ink.<br/>
No movement went unseen."</p>

<p>"A sun, a moon; a sun, a moon.<br/>
My sight, no creature crossed.<br/>
A sun, again; a moon, and then --<br/>
my blood became like frost."</p>

<p>"The night's round face that peers from space --<br/>
did its eye just wink?<br/>
To the south, that gaping mouth --<br/>
did it yawn and shrink?"</p>

<p>"I shook with dread as shadows spread<br/>
across the moon once whole.<br/>
The shadows of a thing -- a wing!<br/>
It stretched from pole to pole!"</p>

<p>"The wing, it swelled; all light was quelled,<br/>
and all the moon obscured.<br/>
Then like a flare, the moon was there --<br/>
and gleaming bright, the bird."</p>

<p>"Its feathers, white like searing ash.<br/>
Its wings, a world across.<br/>
I faced my fated angel Death.<br/>
I faced the ALBATROSS."</p>


<h4>PART III</h4>

<p>"A crack like thunder cleaved the air!<br/>
All heaven heard the blast!<br/>
The shotgun pressed against my chest<br/>
propelled me 'gainst the mast."</p>

<p>"The deadly bird was not deterred.<br/>
Its wings veered not their flight.<br/>
It held me in its hell-black eyes,<br/>
framed with deathly white."</p>

<p>"Another crack erupted forth,<br/>
a blast all heaven heard!<br/>
And still it flew, and still it grew,<br/>
the ghastly ghostly bird."</p>

<p>"My trembling hands refilled the gun,<br/>
my eyes fixed on my foe.<br/>
I hardly heard the startled sailors<br/>
stirring far below."</p>

<p>"The wings arched now from stern to prow.<br/>
The wings consumed the night.<br/>
My senses swirled and all the world<br/>
was dazzling deathly light."</p>

<p>"A crack!  A crack!  I staggered back;<br/>
I crumpled to the floor.<br/>
And then the light of deathly white<br/>
engulfed the night no more."</p>

<p>"A wing fell east, a wing fell west.<br/>
They dropped as from a sieve.<br/>
And I, once mewling mortal man --<br/>
I rose, I stood, I lived!"</p>

<p>"'O Sisyphus!  O Gilgamesh!<br/>
I triumph where you failed!<br/>
I faced the fearsome angel Death;<br/>
I fought and I prevailed!'"</p>

<p>"Once enslaved to dread the grave,<br/>
I stood now free and clear.<br/>
The wingless body fell to earth,<br/>
and with it fell my fear."</p>

<p>"It fell and fell; I laughed and praised<br/>
the barman's blessed device.<br/>
It fell and fell, the ALBATROSS;<br/>
it fell onto the ice."</p>


<h4>PART IV</h4>

<p>"'Ice!' I heard the captain shout.<br/>
'Ice!' the crewmen cried.<br/>
I listened?  No!  I gloated so!<br/>
I laughed with glorious pride!"</p>

<p>"'Ice!'  The ship shook savagely.<br/>
I saw the splinters fly.<br/>
The craft was dashed; I laughed; it crashed;<br/>
I knew I could not die!"</p>

<p>"'Ice!'  The shattered ship collapsed.<br/>
The wreckage heaved and lurched.<br/>
The mainmast cracked, and still I laughed<br/>
while plunging from my perch."</p>

<p>"I fell and laughed and laughed and fell.<br/>
I laughed and laughed until<br/>
the hellish horror struck my sight --<br/>
the scene that's seared there still."</p>

<p>"Five and fifty mortal men,<br/>
my dear and merry crew --<br/>
their limbs were torn, their skin was shorn,<br/>
their lips and tongues were blue."</p>

<p>"Five and fifty murdered men,<br/>
my fault all fifty-five.<br/>
They trusted me to scan the sea,<br/>
but no!  I damned their lives!"</p>

<p>"This horrid scene had no escape --<br/>
the mast gave one last crack.<br/>
My legs were snapped, my body trapped --<br/>
the wreck lay on my back."</p>

<p>"Seven days and seven nights,<br/>
this horror mauled my eye.<br/>
I ate no food, I made no move,<br/>
and yet I did not die."</p>

<p>"Seven days and seven nights<br/>
with every friend I'd known,<br/>
their lifeless blameless eyes forever<br/>
fixed upon my own!"</p>

<p>"O horror more than man can bear!<br/>
Upon the seventh night,<br/>
I seized the sharp-beaked ALBATROSS<br/>
and sacrificed my sight."</p>


<h4>PART V</h4>

<p>"Dark, so dark and comfortless.<br/>
Dark, so dark and cold.<br/>
And like a shroud of shame and pain<br/>
the sea around me rolled."</p>

<p>"Alone, adrift, for weeks or months<br/>
or more, no man can say.<br/>
The sun and moon were absent guests.<br/>
I knew not night from day."</p>

<p>"But time and tide are never still.<br/>
Waves wash all to land.<br/>
With time and tide, I heard the gulls,<br/>
and felt the furrowed sand."</p>

<p>"And friendly voices filled my ears,<br/>
and friendly hands, they gave --<br/>
legs of wood and eyes of glass,<br/>
but not the cure I crave."</p>

<p>"My life's a lurking shadow now,<br/>
a shame that shows no end.<br/>
And death, my fearsome foiled foe,<br/>
now seems a long-lost friend."</p>

<p>"This friend, I seek with every step.<br/>
A thousand days, I've sought.<br/>
A thousand towns, I've borrowed eyes<br/>
to see what I cannot."</p>

<p>The old man gripped his tattered slip.<br/>
He spoke his final words:<br/>
"Have you seen my angel Death?<br/>
Have you seen this bird?"</p>

<p>Thus asked the ancient mariner.<br/>
I stood too stunned to speak.<br/>
And when I finally found my tongue,<br/>
my voice was wan and weak.</p>

<p>"My father's father spoke of it --<br/>
wondrous, white and wild.<br/>
My father claims he saw the same<br/>
when he was just a child."</p>

<p>"But no such creature flies these skies.<br/>
They say the bird's been killed.<br/>
I've never seen the ALBATROSS;<br/>
I've heard I never will."</p>


<h4>PART VI</h4>

<p>It was an ancient mariner<br/>
who stopped me long ago.<br/>
Perhaps he seeks his savior still,<br/>
and spreads his tale of woe.</p>

<p>The fear that steered the wretched man<br/>
is guest to one and all.<br/>
Until I met the mariner,<br/>
I suffered in its thrall.</p>

<p>But now this guest is dispossessed.<br/>
I waste no life on death.<br/>
I sing and dance and seek romance --<br/>
rejoice at every breath!</p>

<p>I fill my days in merry ways.<br/>
I need no grim device.<br/>
For while on earth, I'll prove with mirth<br/>
my birth was worth the price.</p>
